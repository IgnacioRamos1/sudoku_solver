# First i need to input the sudoku board
# Divide each row in lists
# Then i need to check if the board is valid
    # The board is valid if:
        # Each row has no repeated numbers
        # Each column has no repeated numbers
        # Each 3x3 square has no repeated numbers
    # If it is valid, i need to solve it
    # If it is not valid, i need to print the error
# Then i need to print the solved board
    # First find next empty cell
    # Check if the value trying to input is valid
        # Is valid if:
            # The value is not in the row
            # The value is not in the column
            # The value is not in the 3x3 square
    # Use recursion to solve the board
    # Store each value in a list
# Finally print the solved board (stored in the list)
